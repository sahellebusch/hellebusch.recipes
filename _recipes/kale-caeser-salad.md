1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F.
2. On a large rimmed baking sheet, combine the sweet potatoes, chickpeas, 1/4 olive oil, chili powder, paprika, and a pinch each of salt and pepper. Toss well to evenly coat. Transfer to the oven and roast for 40 minutes, stirring halfway, until chickpeas are crispy and potatoes are tender. 
3. Meanwhile, in a large salad bowl, combine the kale and brussels sprouts.
4. To make the dressing. Combine all ingredients in a blender and blend until smooth. Taste and adjust the salt and pepper.
5. Toss the roasted sweet potatoes and chickpeas in with the salad. Add the dressing and toss to combine. Top the salad with avocado and additional parmesan or nutritional yeast. Serve and enjoy!
