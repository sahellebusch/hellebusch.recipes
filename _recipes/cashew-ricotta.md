1. Soak cashews in a bowl of cool water for at least 2 hours (or overnight), covering them with 2 inches of water as they will swell.
2. Drain cashews and place all remaining ingredients into a blender or food processor.  Blend until creamy.
3. (Optional) Store in an airtight container in the fridge for an hour or two to stiffen the mixture a bit.
