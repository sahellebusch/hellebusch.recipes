1. Heat oven to 450. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.  Peel your squash and halve, seed, and cut into 1/2 inch think slices.
2. Toss with 2-3 tbsp olive oil, 1-2 tsp sea salt, and red pepper flakes until evenly coated.
3. Transfer mixture to prepared sheet and roast until tender and slightly colored, anywhere from 20-30 minutes depending on the density of your squash, flipping 2/3 of the way through.  Set aside.
4. Meanwhile, heat 2-3 tbsp olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.  Add onions and salt to taste and cook, stirring frequently, until onions are softened and beginning to brown, about 10-15 minutes.
5. Add vinegar and syrup and reduce heat to medium.  Cook, stirring frequently, until onions are jammy and broken down.
6. Pile onions on top of roasted squash and use a fork to gently mash the mixture.  Taste and adjust seasonings as needed.
7. Heat a skillet over medium-high heat.  Add one tbsp olive oil or butter and cook bread until just golden on both sides.  Drain on paper towels.
8. Spread cheese on toasts, heap with squash and onion mixture and serve.
